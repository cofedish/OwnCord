/**
 * Playwright config for testing against the REAL Tauri production app.
 *
 * Connects to the WebView2 window via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
 *
 * Two projects:
 *
 * 1. `native-no-auth` — Tests that do NOT need login (smoke tests,
 *    connect page UI, auth flow verification). Each test gets a fresh
 *    Tauri exe via the original per-test fixture.
 *
 * 2. `native-authenticated` — Tests that need a logged-in session
 *    (channel nav, chat ops, settings, voice, overlays, app layout).
 *    Uses the persistent fixture: one Tauri exe for the entire project,
 *    login happens once, all tests reuse the same page.
 *
 * This design eliminates server rate limiting (5 logins/min, 10-failure
 * lockout) that previously caused test failures when 8+ spec files each
 * launched a fresh exe and logged in.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Built Tauri exe:  npm run tauri build
 * - Running server:   Server/chatserver.exe (or set OWNCORD_SERVER_URL)
 *
 * Usage:  npm run test:e2e:native
