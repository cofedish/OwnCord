## Critical Rules (Always Apply)

1. **API paths:** `/api/v1/*` (all REST routes prefixed)
2. **DM auth:** Check `ch.Type == "dm"` and `IsDMParticipant()` before touching channel data
3. **Status values:** Only `online`, `idle`, `dnd`, `offline` (never `invisible`)
4. **Rate limits:** Respect client-side [[06-Specs/PROTOCOL|PROTOCOL.md]]: typing 1/3s, presence 1/10s, voice 20/s, chat 10/s
5. **Role names:** Use strings ("admin", "member"), not numeric role_id in UI
6. **Tenor API key:** Public key in `lib/tenor.ts` — not a secret, do not move to env
7. **No hardcoded secrets:** All env vars checked on startup (API keys, JWT secrets, cert paths)
